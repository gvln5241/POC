# POC
Selenium with Page Factory

This is sample project to explore the JAVA, Selenium, Page Factory, Maven & TestNG learnings with GIT as repository.

In com.Util.ScreenShot, tried to take screenshots in different ways 

		1. Normal Screenshot from Selenium web driver, which will be only the web page without URL, system task bar.
		2. Taking Screenshot with ROBOT class, which is equal to 'Ctrl+PrtSc' in keyboard.
		3. Taking Screenshot for specific element only with Selenium web driver only.
